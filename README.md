# Kids Need To Read
[Kids Need To Read (KNTR)](https://www.kidsneedtoread.org/) helps children discover the joy of reading and the power of a literate mind by providing inspiring books and literacy programs to underfunded schools, libraries, and community agencies across the United States, especially those serving disadvantaged children.
## Warehouse
KNTR's receives books as donations and purchases books with financial documentations. Thousands of books. Pallets of books. Red books. Blue books. You get the idea. KNTR has to be able to track which books are in the warehouse and when and what goes to children through KNTR's several programs. 
## This Repository
This purpose built Laravel Orchid app was built by [Brian Wendt](https://github.com/BrianWendt/) to help simplify KNTR's daily operations and improve inventory accuracy.
